Project 1 for CIVE 202


Project Title: Analysis of Nebraska Air Quality Data using PurpleAir Sensors
Team Members: Christopher Moore
Submitted for review: February 3, 2026
Submitted to: UNMC Water, Climate, and Health Working Group
Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to provide a detailed statistical analysis of air quality conditions in Nebraska using data acquired from PurpleAir sensors. Our client, UNMC Water, Climate, and Health Working Group, is specifically interested in understanding trends in air quality to identify locations with consistently poor air quality. Additionally, the client seeks to identify locations that do not meet the Air Quality Index (AQI) standards and would like additional information to why. This project will use python to group, filter, and aggregate data to ensure intended results. 
Project Tasks:
Task 1: Data Extraction and Organization
PurpleAir sensor data for the Nebraska region will be obtained into a CSV file format for use throughout the entire project. The acquired data set will then be prepared and formatted for use in the following steps along with confirming all required information is provided in the acquired CSV file. 
Task 2: Statistical Analysis of Pollutants
The prepared dataset will be analyzed to identify the 5 locations in Nebraska with the highest concentrations of VOC, PM2.5, and PM10. A summary of statistics, specifically maximum values, will be acquired for each sensor location. Additionally, the data will be grouped and filtered by sensor name to identify which sensors experience the highest concentrations of particulate matter. 
Task 3: Analysis of Maximum Concentration Events
Maximum concentration events that are identified in Task 2 will require further analysis to determine the specific dates on which these events occurred. Specifically, the analysis will uncover potential reasons why these days experienced elevated concentrations, while considering environmental factors


Task 4: Temperature Assessment on Concentration Events
Temperature data will be categorized using a predefined threshold of freezing, cool, warm, and hot based on temperature levels. Pollutant concentration will be analyzed based on these identified temperature categories to determine if temperature has any direct impact to air quality levels. 
Task 5: AQI Health Risk Assessment
PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations will be compared to a EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) to determine what is classified to be "unhealth for sensitive populations". Through this analysis, it will be determined when and where AQI health risk events occur at what sensor.
