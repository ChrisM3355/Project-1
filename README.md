Project Title: Analysis of Nebraska Air Quality Data using PurpleAir Sensors

Team Members: Christopher Moore

Submitted for review: February 3, 2026

Submitted to: UNMC Water, Climate, and Health Working Group

Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to provide a detailed statistical analysis of air quality conditions in Nebraska using data acquired from PurpleAir sensors. Our client, UNMC Water, Climate, and Health Working Group, is specifically interested in understanding trends in air quality to identify locations with consistently poor air quality. Additionally, the client seeks to identify locations that do not meet the Air Quality Index (AQI) standards and would like additional information to why. This project will use python to group, filter, and aggregate data to ensure intended results.
